# Todo App Project

## Premise

This project is by no means a giant one, rather an exercise in coding Full-Stack applications independent of tutorials and using only documentation or Google if stuck. 

The basic premise is to be able to code our own applications and features independent of third-party code (i.e., YouTube tutorials or walkthroughs).

[Jody Murray](https://github.com/JodyMurray) is in charge of the backend side of the application, whereas I am in charge of the frontend. 

## Technologies used

This project employs the use of:

* React.js
* Django REST 
* Figma
* SQLite

Possibly more to be added during development.
